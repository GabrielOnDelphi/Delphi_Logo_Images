Create a logo featuring an intricately detailed, ancient Spartan helmet, symbolizing the Delphi programming language. The helmet is constructed from polished gold and adorned with crimson fabric, exuding a regal and majestic presence. It is suspended in mid-air against a stark black background, viewed from a slight angle to add depth and dimension. A soft, golden light illuminates the helmet, accentuating its intricate details and enhancing its luxurious appearance. To subtly nod to the programming theme, faint, glowing lines or symbols may encircle the helmet, ensuring they complement rather than overshadow the central focus. The composition should be balanced, with the helmet centered as the unmistakable focal point of the logo.
